        <!-- Content: About Me Section-->
        <span class="about-me">Hello 👋! I'm Maya, a computer science major at Valencia College in Orlando. I specialize in front-end web development but I hope to expand my skillset to become a full-stack developer.</span>

        <!-- History-->
        <span class="history">I began my learning journey in highschool during quarantine and quickly fell in love with creating websites and simple games from scratch. After spending a few months building static web pages, I debated on whether or not to attend college or sign up for a bootcamp. It wasn't until a few months before graduation that I decided to pursue a degree in computer science. In doing so, I have met plenty of people who specialze in various fields and have taught me so much more than I ever could have on my own .</span>
